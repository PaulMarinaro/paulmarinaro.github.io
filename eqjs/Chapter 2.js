/* FizzBuzz
Write a program that uses console.log to print all the numbers from 
1 to 100, with two exceptions. For numbers divisible by 3, print 
"Fizz" instead of the number, and for numbers divisible by 5 
(and not 3), print "Buzz" instead.

When you have that working, modify your program to print 
"FizzBuzz", for numbers that are divisible by both 3 and 5 
(and still print "Fizz" or "Buzz" for numbers divisible by 
only one of those).

/*
Chess board
Write a program that creates a string that represents an 8Ã—8 grid, 
using newline characters to separate lines. At each position of the 
grid there is either a space or a "#" character. The characters should 
form a chess board.

Passing this string to console.log should show something like this:

 # # # #
# # # # 
 # # # #
# # # # 
 # # # #
# # # # 
 # # # #
# # # #

When you have a program that generates this pattern, define a binding 
size = 8 and change the program so that it works for any size, 
outputting a grid of the given width and height.

var chess = '';
for (var j = 0; j < size; j++) {
  for (var i = 1; i <= size; i++) {
    if ((i + j) % 2 === 0) {
      chess += '#';
    } else {
      chess += ' ';
    }
